ManageDsk
---------

DSK file manager.
Allows to manipulate DSK files like virtual disks.

Usage is quite simple:
3 buttons at the bottom of the interface allow respectively
- Click on "Create DSK": Create a virtual disk format blank DATA
- Click on "Read DSK": Load a DSK as a virtual floppy
- Button "Save DSK": Saving the virtual floppy to DSK file format.

The central window shows a summary of the files on the virtual disk, with:
- The name of the file,
- The user number,
- The write protection attribute,
- File hidden attribute,
- The type of the file,
- The size of the file.
For more information about a file, simply do a
"Right click on it." A pop-up appears with the information
on the selected file. From this popup, it is possible to change
directly certain parameters of the file as:
Its starting address,
Its point of entry,
Its attributes (read-only and hidden file).

The buttons below the window allow the manipulation of files:
- Click on "Add file (s)": Enables the addition of 1 or more files
virtual floppy. Selecting multiple files is done using
of the standard Windows interface (CTRL key held down).
- Button "Export File (s)" Retrieves the virtual floppy
One or more files. Just select the window or
export files (by holding down the CTRL key in the case of
multiple files) and click on the button. We can rename each
files before export.
- Button "Rename File (s)": Rename one or more files
virtual floppy. Just select the window or
export files (by holding down the CTRL key in the case of
multiple files) and click on the button. We can then edit
the file name and the number of User.
- "Delete File (s)": Delete a file or files
the virtual disk. Just select the window or
export files (by holding down the CTRL key in the case of
multiple files) and click on the button. Confirmation of
suppression will be required for each file.

The check box "automatic cleaning of headers AMSDOS format" allows
to clear (fill with zeros) the unused bytes in the header AMSDOS
basic or BINARY files. This option lets you save space in
compression of a file in ZIP format DSK example.
This works both ways: import files into
Virtual Floppy and for export to the PC hard drive.

Command line
-----------------

Since version 0.8, ManageDsk can be used from the command line,
or from a batch file (. BAT or. CMD) when it is launched with one or
several arguments, it does not open the interface, but performs the functions
that are specified on the command line.
The parameters accepted by the command line are:
-Ldskname: read a DSK file.
-C: Create a blank DSK
-Afilemasks: add one or more files to. DSK.
The files are added as is, without creation / modification of the header
AMSDOS possible they may contain.
-Sdskname: saves the dsk under a particular name
-Ifullpathname/fichierCPC/type/debut/execution: Add a file
specifying the information to be written in the header AMSDOS: file type,
start address and port of entry (execution address).
Examples:-IC:\MYFILE/TOTO.BIN/BIN/16384/16384
                -I"D:\documents and settings\foo\my ecran.src"/ECRAN.SCR/BIN/49152
                -IC:\testbasic/PROG.BAS/BAS/368
                -IC:\file/test/ASCII
For ascii files, no need to specify starting address and execution.


The arguments can be followed on the command line, and must be
separated by spaces.

A typical example of creating a dsk, adding binary files, then
save this dsk as the toto.dsk:

ManageDsk -C -A*.BIN -Stoto.dsk

Another example: Reading a dsk, adding .BAS and .BIN files and saving :

ManageDsk -LOld.dsk -A*.BAS -A*.BIN -SNew.dsk

Note:
- Each command (argument) starts with the character '-' (minus character)
- The command options (file name) must be joined to the
control (no spaces)
- Orders can be entered in uppercase or lowercase.
- For the moment, five commands are known:
    -L: Read DSK
    -C: Create DSK
    -A: Adding files to DSK
    -S: Save DSK
    -I: Adding a file with optionally specifying the parameters of the AMSDOS header

Read/write directly on 3.5-inch disk
------------------------------------
Since version 0.15, ManageDsk can read/write directly to 3.5-inch floppy disks.
This allows for example:
- Read a 3.5-inch disk and create the corresponding DSK,
- Dsk read a file and write it to 3.5-inch disk in order to use the 3.5-inch
disk of CPC
This is possible by using the driver fdrawcmd.sys Simon Owen.
It is therefore necessary to install this driver to use these
new features read/write direct.
fdrawcmd.sys is not delivered in the archive, but is free disponnible
